1. install node https://nodejs.org/  
2. clone repository  
3. nagivate to cloned directory in terminal  
4. install http-server by running $ npm install -g http-server  
5. run $ npm start  
6. point web browser to http://localhost:8000

Teams will learn:  
1. bootstrap responsive framework  
2. angular javascript introduction  
3. two way databinding with models  
4. custom element directives  
5. reading in data with ajax call to json file

Goals:  
1. keep codebase simple as possible to understand, run, and install  
2. keep scope within an hour timelimit  
3. allow for feeling of achomplishment with a low probability of failure  
4. provide tasks for complete non-technical leaders to achieve  

Imagined Overview:  
everyone will sit through a short presentation on bootstrap and angular to learn about the new technologies. these slides will include code snippits earily simular to correct app code. teams will then form and customize their own parody company app based on given skeleton code; non-technical leaders can edit json file detailing company information (very easy task). Teams will then use knowlage from presentation to develop the app reffering back to the powerpoint when lost. James, Michael, Joe, Ben, Saumya will be walking around to help when needed. At the end teams will present their app and parody company.
